            <h2 class="section-title">The Battle of the Frontiers</h2>
            <p>
                The Battle of the Frontiers were a series battles fought
                along the eastern frontier of France and in southern Belgium,
                shortly after the outbreak of the First World War.
            </p>
            <p>
                The outbreak of the war was especially gruesome as it was the first time
                in 100 years that the major powers of europe came to blows. A marriage of
                Napoleanoic Tactics and modern weapons produced a charnal horror house which
                the world had never seen.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, during the inital French push against the Germans,
                they suffered
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">
                    27,000 killed in a single day
                </a>

                        The Germans sought to execute their Schlieffen plan. they hoped to achieve a swift victory
                        by completely encircling the French army, recreating the feat Hannibal Barca
                        had inflicted on Rome at the battle of Canae.

            <p>
                what resulted was known as the race to the sea. Both armies pushed north in a
                desperate attempt to out flank each other.
                neither army got the upper hand, and in the soldiers' desperate attempt
                to avoid the terrific amount of steel and shrapnel flying above ground,
                they went underground, forming trenches that remained mostly static throughout the duration of the war.

                You'd be forgiven for not thinking much of the second battle of the ypres.
                After all, there would be 4 battles for the ypres by wars end.

                        The Battle of the Somme represented one of the worst day for the british empire.
                        intended to relieve the french suffering at the battle of Verdun, it saw colossal loss of life.
                        the united kingdom enacted the "pal" enlistment policy which encouraged men to enlist under
                        the promise that they coud serve with their friends. This had the horrific uninteded consequence
                        of many english towns having their male populations decimated in a single day.
