            <h2 class="section-title">The Battle of the Frontiers</h2>
            <p>
                The Battle of the Frontiers were a series battles fought
                along the eastern frontier of France and in southern Belgium,
                shortly after the outbreak of the First World War.
            </p>
            <p>
                The outbreak of the war was especially gruesome as it was the first time
                in 100 years that the major powers of europe came to blows. A marriage of
                Napoleanoic Tactics and modern weapons produced a charnal horror house which
                the world had never seen.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, during the inital French push against the Germans,
                they suffered
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">
                    27,000 killed in a single day
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Germans sought to execute their Schlieffen plan. they hoped to achieve a swift victory
                by completely encircling the French army, recreating the feat Hannibal Barca
                had inflicted on Rome at the battle of Canae.
            </p>
            <p>there would be no swift victory</p>

            <p>
                what resulted was known as the race to the sea. Both armies pushed north in a
                desperate attempt to out flank each other.
                neither army got the upper hand, and in the soldiers' desperate attempt
                to avoid the terrific amount of steel and shrapnel flying above ground,
                they went underground, forming trenches that remained mostly static throughout the duration of the war.

                <p>
                    The Battle of the Somme represented one of the worst day for the british empire.
                    intended to relieve the french suffering at the battle of Verdun, it saw colossal loss of life.
                    the united kingdom enacted the "pal" enlistment policy which encouraged men to enlist under
                    the promise that they coud serve with their friends. This had the horrific uninteded consequence of
                    Many english towns having their male populations decimated in a single day.

                        the battle of the Somme saw the introduction of Tanks.
                        The British fielded the mark I tank, the first of its kind.
                        The tank terrified the German defender but deployed in too few
                        numbers it was ultimately ineffective

                    the Somme, like most other WWI offensives, was a failure.
                    instead of invograting the British Empire forces, it demoralized them.
                    The British general Sir Douglas Haig earned his nickname,
                    <em class="red">the Butcher</em> of the Somme
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the novel, <em>Tender is the Night</em> F. Scott Fitzgeral wrote of the Somme:
                <blockquote>"See that little stream — we could walk to it in two minutes. It took the British a month to
                    walk to it — a whole empire walking very slowly, dying in front and pushing forward behind. And
                    another empire walked very slowly backward a few inches a day, leaving the dead like a million
                    bloody rugs. . .there was a century of middle-class love spent here"</blockquote>

                    Despite Americas modern reputation for a formidable army,

                    as little more than a band of cowboys. The Largest and bloodiest War America had fought was against
                    itself.
                    They had barely been able to secure their southern border against
                    the likes of Pancho Via who had led the then Lieutenant Patton and AEF on a
