            <h2 class="section-title">The Battle of the Frontiers</h2>
            <p>
                The Battle of the Frontiers were a series battles fought
                along the eastern frontier of France and in southern Belgium,
                shortly after the outbreak of the First World War.
            </p>
            <p>
                The outbreak of the war was especially gruesome as it was the first time
                in 100 years that the major powers of europe came to blows. A marriage of
                Napoleanoic Tactics and modern weapons produced a charnal horror house which
                the world had never seen.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, during the inital French push against the Germans,
                they suffered
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">
                    27,000 killed in a single day
                </a>

                        The Germans sought to execute their Schlieffen plan. they hoped to achieve a swift victory
                        by completely encircling the French army, recreating the feat Hannibal Barca
                        had inflicted on Rome at the battle of Canae.

            <p>
                what resulted was known as the race to the sea. Both armies pushed north in a
                desperate attempt to out flank each other.
                neither army got the upper hand, and in the soldiers' desperate attempt
                to avoid the terrific amount of steel and shrapnel flying above ground,
                they went underground, forming trenches that remained mostly static throughout the duration of the war.

                You'd be forgiven for not thinking much of the second battle of the ypres.

                        The Battle of the Somme represented one of the worst day for the british empire.
                        intended to relieve the french suffering at the battle of Verdun, it saw colossal loss of life.
                        the united kingdom enacted the "pal" enlistment policy which encouraged men to enlist under
                        the promise that they coud serve with their friends. This had the horrific uninteded consequence
                        of many english towns having their male populations decimated in a single day.

                            the Somme, like most other WWI offensives, was a failure.
                            instead of invograting the British Empire forces, it demoralized them.
                            The British general <span class="txt-accent-prim"> Sir Douglas Haig</span> earned his
                            nickname,

                        <p>
                            In the novel, <em>Tender is the Night</em> F. Scott Fitzgeral wrote of the Somme:
                        <blockquote>"See that little stream — we could walk to it in two minutes. It took the British a
                            month to
                            walk to it — a whole empire walking very slowly, dying in front and pushing forward behind.
                            And
                            another empire walked very slowly backward a few inches a day, leaving the dead like a
                            million
                            bloody rugs. . .there was a century of middle-class love spent here"</blockquote>

                    Despite Americas modern reputation for a formidable army,
                    at the turn of the century, European powers thought of the American Expeditionay Forces (AEF)
                    as little more than a band of cowboys. The Largest and bloodiest War America had fought was against
                    itself.
                    They had barely been able to secure their southern border against
                    the likes of Pancho Via who had led the then Lieutenant Patton and AEF on a
                    wild goose chase through the Mexican desert.

                    Would the fresh-faced American troops be able to turn the tide?<br>
                    Would the entante persist if they couldn't? <br>
                    the world waited on bated breath

                        <p> in 1917, Russia withdrew from the war. Now able to consolidate their army on a single front
                            for one final push in 1918
                            ,The German forces caught the entente off gaurd. The French army was being overwhelmed at
                            bella woods;
                            the AEF moved in to reinforce them

                            The French forces urged the americans to retreat

                            the americans answered: "Retreat? Hell, we just got here.

                            in another incident at Bellau woods, americans came under heavy fire from german machine

                        <p>
                            seeing his marines paralyzed with fear, then 44 year old Dan Daly rose to his feet and
                            screamed: </p>
                        <p>"Come on, you sons of bitches! Do you want to live forever?"
                            and began advancing on the machine gun nest, firing his rifle from the hip

                        <p>
                            Daly's words would be immortalized some 80 years later in the cult-classic film starship
                            troopers: where the main characters would parody the rally cry as
                            "common you apes do you wanna live forever?"
